@article{Travers-Trolet2014,
	Abstract = {The effects of climate and fishing on marine ecosystems have usually been studied separately, but their interactions make ecosystem dynamics difficult to understand and predict. Of particular interest to management, the potential synergism or antagonism between fishing pressure and climate forcing is analysed in this paper, using an end-to-end ecosystem model of the southern Benguela ecosystem, built from coupling hydrodynamic, biogeochemical and multispecies fish models (ROMS-N2P2Z2D2-OSMOSE). Scenarios of different intensities of upwelling-favourable wind stress combined with scenarios of fishing top-predator fish were tested. Analyses of isolated drivers show that the bottom-up effect of the climate forcing propagates up the food chain whereas the top-down effect of fishing cascades down to zooplankton in unfavourable environmental conditions but dampens before it reaches phytoplankton. When considering both climate and fishing drivers together, it appears that top-down control dominates the link between top-predator fish and forage fish, whereas interactions between the lower trophic levels are dominated by bottom-up control. The forage fish functional group appears to be a central component of this ecosystem, being the meeting point of two opposite trophic controls. The set of combined scenarios shows that fishing pressure and upwelling-favourable wind stress have mostly dampened effects on fish populations, compared to predictions from the separate effects of the stressors. Dampened effects result in biomass accumulation at the top predator fish level but a depletion of biomass at the forage fish level. This should draw our attention to the evolution of this functional group, which appears as both structurally important in the trophic functioning of the ecosystem, and very sensitive to climate and fishing pressures. In particular, diagnoses considering fishing pressure only might be more optimistic than those that consider combined effects of fishing and environmental variability.},

	Abstract = {In the arcto-boreal Barents Sea, temperature variability is an important source for the pronounced year-to-year fluctuations in fish recruitment. Sea temperature is closely linked to the volume flux of the relatively warm Atlantic water masses flowing in from southwest, as well as to regional heat exchange with the atmosphere. We examine the relations between Barents Sea temperature, inflow, and North Atlantic scale climate variability. For the last three decades, large-scale climate forcing statistically has accounted for 75\% of the variability in the barotrophic inflow, whereas the North Atlantic Oscillation and sea temperature combined statistically explain 55\% of the variability in cod recruitment. Our results suggest a chain-of-events relationship between large-scale atmospheric variability, Barents Sea oceanography and the ecology of this highly productive region.},

@article{Lindegren13672,
	Abstract = {Since the days of Elton, population cycles have challenged ecologists and resource managers. Although the underlying mechanisms remain debated, theory holds that both density-dependent and density-independent processes shape the dynamics. One striking example is the large-scale fluctuations of sardine and anchovy observed across the major upwelling areas of the world. Despite a long history of research, the causes of these fluctuations remain unresolved and heavily debated, with significant implications for fisheries management. We here model the underlying causes of these fluctuations, using the California Current Ecosystem as a case study, and show that the dynamics, accurately reproduced since A.D. 1661 onward, are explained by interacting density-dependent processes (i.e., through species-specific life-history traits) and climate forcing. Furthermore, we demonstrate how fishing modifies the dynamics and show that the sardine collapse of the 1950s was largely unavoidable given poor recruitment conditions. Our approach provides unique insight into the origin of sardine{\textendash}anchovy fluctuations and a knowledge base for sustainable fisheries management in the California Current Ecosystem and beyond.},

@article{Bjornsson2011,
	Abstract = {The interaction between two species of gadoid and a shrimp stock was studied in a 40 km long two-armed fjord in north-west Iceland. On the basis of acoustic and trawl surveys in 2005 and 2006, immature cod Gadus morhua and haddock Melanogrammus aeglefinus were found to migrate to the inner part of the fjord in late summer, concurrent with rising temperatures. At the same time, the local northern shrimp Pandalus borealis stock retreated into the north-east arm of the fjord. Vertical distribution of acoustic targets indicated that a significant and temporally variable fraction of the gadoids was inaccessible to the trawl. Shrimp was a significant part of the diet of immature G. morhua, except in June 2006 when euphausiids comprised most of the diet of both G. morhua and M. aeglefinus. Shrimp was only a minor part of the diet of M. aeglefinus. An on--off relationship was observed in the catches of gadoids and shrimp. In hauls with large catches of gadoids, few shrimp were found and vice versa, indicating avoidance reaction at this spatial scale. The cooling in winter may have driven the gadoids to the outer parts of the fjord, which in turn may have aided in the dispersal of the shrimp stock in the following months.},

@article{B:2017aa,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: Changes in stock size of a top predator have been found to cascade through the trophic levels, but the mechanism has not been fully clarified. Using data from annual trawl surveys within a fjord during 1988-2015, we present evidence that changes in abundance of cod <i>Gadus morhua</i> and haddock <i>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</i> have an immediate effect on the distribution and a more gradual effect on the abundance of northern shrimp <i>Pandalus borealis</i>. During the first years, the abundance of the gadoids was low and the shrimp was widely spread in the fjord. Following a major increase in gadoid abundance in 2004, the shrimp stock appeared to retreat into the innermost part of the fjord and in the year after the shrimp abundance plummeted. Since that time, the shrimp stock has remained within the same restricted inner area of the fjord while the gadoids have occupied the outer area. A generalized additive model (GAM) indicated that cod had a stronger negative effect than haddock on shrimp abundance in the following year. Stomach content analysis confirmed a greater shrimp consumption by cod than by haddock. Increased bottom temperature may have had an indirect effect on shrimp by attracting more gadoids to the fjord. In tows with large catches of shrimp there were usually few cod and haddock, and vice versa. However, cod juveniles occupied the area in which large shrimp catches were obtained. },

	Abstract = {The three-dimensional structure and the origin of mesoscale anticyclonic intrathermocline eddies (ITEs) in the coastal transition zone (CTZ) off central Chile (31--41$\,^{\circ}$S) were analyzed through the combination of data from oceanographic cruises and satellite altimetry, and the application of an eddy-resolving primitive equation ocean model coupled with a numerical experiment using a passive tracer. In this region, ITEs are represented by subsurface lenses (∼100 km diameter; 500 m thickness or vertical extension) of nearly homogeneous salinity (>34.5) and oxygen-deficient (<1.0 mL L−1) waters, properties which are linked to the equatorial subsurface water mass (ESSW) transported poleward by the Peru-Chile undercurrent (PCUC) in the coastal band. At least five to seven ITEs were observed simultaneously in the area between 31$\,^{\circ}$ and 38$\,^{\circ}$S during winter cruises in 1997 and 2009. Satellite data indicated that the ITEs identified from in situ data moved westward, each at a mean speed of ∼2 km d−1 and transported a total volume of ∼1 × 106 m3 s−1 (=1 Sv); the lifespan of each ITE ranged from a few months to 1 year. Model results indicate that ITEs become detached from the PCUC under summer upwelling conditions in the coastal zone.},

	Abstract = {The use of structural equation modeling (SEM) is often motivated by its utility for investigating complex networks of relationships, but also because of its promise as a means of representing theoretical concepts using latent variables. In this paper, we discuss characteristics of ecological theory and some of the challenges for proper specification of theoretical ideas in structural equation models (SE models). In our presentation, we describe some of the requirements for classical latent variable models in which observed variables (indicators) are interpreted as the effects of underlying causes. We also describe alternative model specifications in which indicators are interpreted as having causal influences on the theoretical concepts. We suggest that this latter nonclassical specification (which involves another variable type---the composite) will often be appropriate for ecological studies because of the multifaceted nature of our theoretical concepts. In this paper, we employ the use of meta-models to aid the translation of theory into SE models and also to facilitate our ability to relate results back to our theories. We demonstrate our approach by showing how a synthetic theory of grassland biodiversity can be evaluated using SEM and data from a coastal grassland. In this example, the theory focuses on the responses of species richness to abiotic stress and disturbance, both directly and through intervening effects on community biomass. Models examined include both those based on classical forms (where each concept is represented using a single latent variable) and also ones in which the concepts are recognized to be multifaceted and modeled as such. To address the challenge of matching SE models with the conceptual level of our theory, two approaches are illustrated, compositing and aggregation. Both approaches are shown to have merits, with the former being preferable for cases where the multiple facets of a concept have widely differing effects in the system and the latter being preferable where facets act together consistently when influencing other parts of the system. Because ecological theory characteristically deals with concepts that are multifaceted, we expect the methods presented in this paper will be useful for ecologists wishing to use SEM.},

	Abstract = {The recruitment rate of anchovy in the Peru--Chile upwelling system was studied by testing sensitive to environmental variability when the spawning stock is low in abundance. Times series of sea surface temperature, salinity, depth of the 15$\,^{\circ}$C isotherm, the upper limit of the oxygen minimum zone, upwelling indices, the Southern Oscillation Index, and indices El Ni{\~n}o 1+2 and El Ni{\~n}o 3.4 were summarized trough Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The first PCA (PC-I) explained 57% of variance and was related to interannual variability driven by the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation. The second Principal Component explained 15% of variance and was linked to upwelling indices. Anchovy recruitment rate anomalies were correlated with PC-I scores on the basis of a 6-year-moving-window and accumulated correlation as time progressed. Significant correlation coefficients were found when the spawning stock biomass was low in abundance before 1990. Once sufficient spawning biomass was accumulated (after 1990), the stock was less sensitive to environmental variability. Thus, sensitivity to environmental changes in anchovy, and probably in other small pelagic fishes, is stock-size dependent. This is a key aspect to be considered in the management of transboundary fish stock shared between Chile and Peru, upon current efforts to develop an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.},

	Abstract = {Spatial processes are rarely considered explicitly in the evaluation and management of marine invertebrate populations. This is particularly true when larval drift acts as one of the main mechanisms of population expansion. The ecological concept metapopulation is widely used and accepted for understanding low-mobility marine populations. This study uses a length-based dynamic analysis model for nylon shrimp (Heterocarpus reedi) exploited off central Chile (25$\,^{\circ}$--37$\,^{\circ}$S) to contrast various hypotheses of population structure and spatial connectivity. The two subpopulations studied are located to the north and south of 32$\,^{\circ}$S. The model is fitted to the historical fishery data (from the mid-1940s to the present), the results of monitoring of fishing activities (1970s-present), and research surveys (1990s-present). Statistically, several hypotheses can explain the data. The most likely hypothesis is that of a metapopulation in which the south zone acts as a source population (reproductive refuge) and determines, partially or totally, the recruits in the north zone, thereby explaining the population increase over the last decade. Empirical evidence will strengthen the hypothesis of spatial connectivity and special attention should be paid to the biological-fishery conditions recorded south of 32$\,^{\circ}$S given the implications for managing the fishery for this resource.},

	Abstract = {Two key elements in the adequate, sustained exploitation of any fishery should be considered; the biological attributes of the species and how these vary over time and space. Research is needed to obtain a more thorough understanding of these effects, how they vary, and how they relate to environmental factors. For 17 years, biological information has been collected for Heterocarpus reedi (nylon shrimp) caught off central Chile (25--37$\,^{\circ}$S). Here, we analyze these data using generalized linear models and determine the factors responsible for changes in carapace length, body weight, maturity, and sex ratio. The environmental and alimentary conditions are better south of 32$\,^{\circ}$S, and this is probably associated with the better physical condition and reproductive attributes of H. reedi there. For example, individuals are larger, females are longer at first maturity (CL50%), and mature females are less prevalent. We outline a theoretical foundation that can guide future research on H. reedi. We also suggest that future conservation measures consider biological attributes within a spatial context.},

We use Bayesian approach to obtain inference, and the posterior distributions are approximated using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.

	Abstract = {The population structure of fishery resources and the impact of environmental factors over its productivity are important processes to be considered in fisheries management. Environmental factors could determine both, the success of larval drift as the population spatial structure and its changes of biomass. In this paper we show the environmental effect over distribution, abundance and spatial structure of nylon shrimp population (Heterocarpus reedi) off central Chile (25$\,^{\circ}$-37$\,^{\circ}$S) from trawling surveys carried out between 1996 and 2011. Environmental variables considered where sea surface concentration of chlorophyll-a and dissolved organic matter. Results show a geographical separation in population around 32$\,^{\circ}$S. Shrimp density is higher in the southern zone, where concentration of chlorophyll-a and dissolved organic matter are high due to presence of river tributaries and coastal upwelling zones. In this area, the bulk of the adult population is concentrated, which could act as \"source\" population and thereby its influence on larval drift could explain both, the preponderance of juveniles in the northern area as the smallest size of its population (``pseudo-sink'' population). In the southern area, a process of spatial and bathymetric expansion had driven the increase in population size over time, where the colonization and individual somatic growth had been the main mechanisms. We found that periods of good environmental conditions explain high densities of shrimp with a delay of two years, which might be related mainly with larval survival and enhanced recruitment and somatic growth. The aim of this study was to understand the spatial-temporal variability of the nylon shrimp density in the study area.},

	Abstract = {Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is an ecologically- and commercially-important species in the northeast Pacific Ocean. Detailed records of herring spawn off the coast of British Columbia (BC), Canada, collected annually since 1928, indicate that spawn distribution has gone through systematic changes over time. The cessation of spawning in some areas has led to concerns that commercial herring fisheries have resulted in serial depletion of local spawning. However, previous studies suggested that changes in spawn distribution may not necessarily be fisheries induced. Hitherto, there have been no satisfactory explanations for these changes. In this study, we developed boosted regression tree (BRT) models for four major spawning regions in BC (the Prince Rupert District, Haida Gwaii, the Central Coast, and the West Coast of Vancouver Island) to explore the nonlinear relationships between herring spawn abundance and environmental variables, including two indices of Pacific Ocean basin-scale variability (the PDO: Pacific Decadal Oscillation; and the NPGO: North Pacific Gyre Oscillation) and regional scale wind-stress off the BC coast. We find a ``bowl-shaped'' relationship between herring spawn abundance and two environmental variables (the PDO and NPGO) across all spawning regions and a ``dome-shaped'' relationship between spawn abundance and upwelling-favorable wind-stress, the latter indicating that there is an optimal range of wind stress values that favor herring spawn abundance. Results also suggest that, in Haida Gwaii, herring spawn abundance has been primarily governed by the NPGO and downwelling-favorable alongshore wind-stress; in contrast, the PDO and upwelling-favorable alongshore wind-stress are top contributors to spawn fluctuations in all other regions. These results help facilitate our understanding of how changes in physical environmental conditions affect herring spawn abundance as well as subsequent population dynamics.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: Changes in the size distribution of zooplankton in the Humboldt Current System have been hypothesized to underlie observed changes in sardine and anchovy populations, the dominant pelagic fish species. To examine this hypothesis, the size distribution of over 15000 zooplankton data samples collected since the 1960s was qualitatively determined. Dominance of each size group of zooplankton (small, medium and large) and of euphausiids was modelled using generalized additive models as a function of year, latitude, time of day, distance from the 200 m isobath (a surrogate for on-shelf versus off-shelf), sea surface temperature and salinity. The temporal (yr) pattern for euphausiid dominance was highly cross-correlated (i.e. was in phase) with the time series for estimated biomass of anchovy, and small zooplankton dominance with that for estimated sardine biomass. This supports the focal hypothesis based on feeding-energetic experiments, which showed energetic advantages to sardine filter feeding on smaller zooplankton and to anchovy bite feeding on larger copepods and euphausiids. Although euphausiids predominate offshore from the shelf break, anchovy biomass is generally highest on the shelf, suggesting a possible mismatch between anchovy feeding and euphausiid dominance. However, evidence concerning the offshore expansion of the anchovy range in cooler conditions, where both anchovy and euphausiids predominate, somewhat alleviates this apparent contradiction. A strong diel component to euphausiids and large zooplankton indicated diel migration for these zooplankton groups. That anchovy will preferentially eat euphausiids when they are more available (i.e. during the night and offshore) is supported by anchovy diet data. },

	Abstract = {The eastern boundary of the Chile-Peru Current System constitutes one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world, due largely to coastal upwelling and the horizontal advection of nutrients. In this ecosystem, El Ni{\~n}o events are of great importance in the interannual variability of the environment. A change was observed in the environmental regime at the beginning of the 1970s with the onset of the 1972- 1973 El Ni{\~n}o, marking an important decrease in the anchovy fishery (Engraulis ringens). After the mid-1970s, sardine (Sardinops sagax) landings increased noticeably. A second regime shift at the end of the 1980s was seen mostly in the noticeable recovery of anchovy and the decline of sardine. Herein, we present an integrated conceptual model of the different local and large-scale phenomena that affect the marine environment off northern Chile and the distribution and abundance of pelagic resources. The model considers an analysis of environmental and bio-fishery data on different scales and describes how the interdecadal (associated with regime shifts) and interannual (associated with El Ni{\~n}o events) fluctuations in the Equatorial Pacific are manifested in the eastern South Pacific and, therefore, in the northern zone off Chile, affecting the annual cycle, the dynamic of the coastal trapped waves, and coastal upwelling. In this framework, interdecadal fluctuations play an important role in the anchovy-sardine-anchovy replacement sequence.},

@article{ALHEIT2004201,
	Abstract = {Of the four major eastern boundary currents, the Humboldt Current (HC) stands out because it is extremely productive, dominated by anchovy dynamics and subject to frequent direct environmental perturbations of the El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The long-term dynamics of the HC ecosystem are controlled by shifts between alternating anchovy and sardine regimes that restructure the entire ecosystem from phytoplankton to the top predators. These regime shifts are caused by lasting periods of warm or cold temperature anomalies related to the approach or retreat of warm subtropical oceanic waters to the coast of Peru and Chile. Phases with mainly negative temperature anomalies parallel anchovy regimes (1950--1970; 1985 to the present) and the rather warm period from 1970 to 1985 was characterized by sardine dominance. The transition periods (turning points) from one regime to the other were 1968--1970 and 1984--1986. Like an El Nino, the warm periods drastically change trophic relationships in the entire HC ecosystem, exposing the Peruvian anchovy to a multitude of adverse conditions. Positive temperature anomalies off Peru drive the anchovy population close to the coast as the coastal upwelling cells usually offer the coolest environment, thereby substantially decreasing the extent of the areas of anchovy distribution and spawning. This enhances the effects of negative density-dependent processes such as egg and larval cannibalism and dramatically increases its catchability. Increased spatial overlap between anchovies and the warmer water preferring sardines intensifies anchovy egg mortality further as sardines feed heavily on anchovy eggs. Food sources for juvenile and adult anchovies which prey on a mixed diet of phyto- and zooplankton are drastically reduced because of decreased plankton production due to restricted upwelling in warm years, as demonstrated by lower zooplankton and phytoplankton volumes and the diminution of the fraction of large copepods, their main food source. Horse mackerel and mackerel, the main predators of anchovy, increase predation pressure on juvenile and adult anchovies due to extended invasion into the anchovy habitat in warmer years. In contrast to these periods of warm and cold temperature anomalies on the decadal scale, ENSO events do not play an important role for long-term anchovy dynamics, as the anchovy can recover even from strong ENSO events within 1--2 years. Consequently, the strong 1972--1973 ENSO event (in combination with overfishing) was not the cause of the famous crash of the Peruvian anchovy fishery in the 1970s.},

@article{Cury2000,
	Abstract = {{In upwelling ecosystems, there is often a crucial intermediate trophic level, occupied by small, plankton-feeding pelagic fish dominated by one or a few schooling species. Their massive populations may vary radically in size under intensive exploitation. We have used decadal-scale time series to explore patterns of interactions between these fish, their prey, and their predators so as to quantify functional roles of small pelagic fish in those ecosystems. Top-down control of zooplankton is detected off South Africa, Ghana, Japan, and in the Black Sea. Conversely, bottom-up control of predators, such as predatory fish and marine birds, is observed in the Benguela, Guinea, and Humboldt currents. Thus small pelagic fish exert a major control on the trophic dynamics of upwelling ecosystems and constitute midtrophic-level ``wasp-waist'' populations. Ecosystem effects of fishing are addressed by considering potential structural changes at different scales of observation, ranging from individuals, via school dynamics, to food webs. The overall impact is explored using a trophic model (Ecosim) given different types of food web control. Ecosystem dynamics can be entirely different depending on how the food web is controlled (bottom-up, top-down or wasp-waist). The threat of eroding intra-specific diversity is emphasized because it may lead to a long-term decline in the productivity of the pelagic fish resources. School composition is shown to reflect the relative species abundance within the pelagic community and functions as a ``school trap'' that could maintain a collapsed population in a depleted state for lengthy periods, and affect spatial dynamics such as migrations. As a result, overfishing can alter the abundance, composition, and distribution in pelagic communities, and may induce drastic changes of state. Predation on zooplankton by the jack mackerel (Trachurus symmetricus murphyi) population in the South Pacific provides an example of the alteration of matter fluxes in trophic webs caused by fishery removals. In conclusion, it is doubtful that pelagic fisheries will continue to increase without major disruptions to ecosystems.}},

@article{Lehodey2006,
	Abstract = {{Fish population variability and fisheries activities are closely linked to weather and climate dynamics. While weather at sea directly affects fishing, environmental variability determines the distribution, migration, and abundance of fish. Fishery science grew up during the last century by integrating knowledge from oceanography, fish biology, marine ecology, and fish population dynamics, largely focused on the great Northern Hemisphere fisheries. During this period, understanding and explaining interannual fish recruitment variability became a major focus for fisheries oceanographers. Yet, the close link between climate and fisheries is best illustrated by the effect of ``unexpected'' events---that is, nonseasonal, and sometimes catastrophic---on fish exploitation, such as those associated with the El Ni{\~n}o--Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The observation that fish populations fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony while being geographically separated drew attention to oceanographic processes driven by low-frequency signals, as reflected by indices tracking large-scale climate patterns such as the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). This low-frequency variability was first observed in catch fluctuations of small pelagic fish (anchovies and sardines), but similar effects soon emerged for larger fish such as salmon, various groundfish species, and some tuna species. Today, the availability of long time series of observations combined with major scientific advances in sampling and modeling the oceans' ecosystems allows fisheries science to investigate processes generating variability in abundance, distribution, and dynamics of fish species at daily, decadal, and even centennial scales. These studies are central to the research program of Global Ocean Ecosystems Dynamics (GLOBEC). This review presents examples of relationships between climate variability and fisheries at these different time scales for species covering various marine ecosystems ranging from equatorial to subarctic regions. Some of the known mechanisms linking climate variability and exploited fish populations are described, as well as some leading hypotheses, and their implications for their management and for the modeling of their dynamics. It is concluded with recommendations for collaborative work between climatologists, oceanographers, and fisheries scientists to resolve some of the outstanding problems in the development of sustainable fisheries.}},

@article{PERRY2010331,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the case for the adoption of a social--ecological approach to marine systems, which recognises the interdependence of biophysical and human social components. It discusses the management and governance challenges that arise when biophysical marine systems and fishing-dependent human communities, considered as interdependent marine social--ecological systems, are stressed by global changes. Drivers of change in marine biophysical systems include processes such as climate variability and change, human processes such as fishing, habitat degradation, and contaminants, and their interactions. Fishing makes marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems more sensitive to climate forcing. Human communities' responses to marine ecosystem variability can ameliorate or exacerbate these changes. Drivers of change in fishing-dependent human communities include environmental and resource changes, human social changes relating to demographics, health issues, and shifting societal values, and their interactions at local and global scales. This multi-faceted interdependence means that fisheries management needs to develop approaches which maintain the capacities of both fish and fishing communities, acting as interactive social--ecological systems, to adapt to the impacts of globalization and environmental change. In general, a less-heavily fished marine system managed on an ecosystem basis is likely to provide more stable catches under normal conditions than would a heavily fished system. However, under climate change the whole ecosystem may alter in ways that cannot yet be predicted. Issues of scale are crucial, and fisheries governance needs a concerted effort to contrast and compare multiple local management `experiments', since the exposure, susceptibility, and adaptive capacities of biophysical and human social marine systems varies immensely. These `experiments' should be conducted in developed and developing nations so as to understand the range of policy issues which support marine social--ecological systems in an era of global change.},

@article{OVERLAND2010305,
	Abstract = {This paper discusses large-scale climate variability for several marine ecosystems and suggests types of ecosystem responses to climate change. Our analysis of observations and model results for the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans concludes that most climate variability is accounted for by the combination of intermittent 1--2 year duration events, e.g. the cumulative effect of monthly weather anomalies or the more organized El Ni{\~n}o/La Ni{\~n}a, plus broad-band ``red noise'' intrinsic variability operating at decadal and longer timescales. While ocean processes such as heat storage and lags due to ocean circulation provide some multi-year memory to the climate system, basic understanding of the mechanisms resulting in observed large decadal variability is lacking and forces the adoption of a ``stochastic or red noise'' conceptual model of low frequency variability at the present time. Thus we conclude that decadal events with rapid shifts and major departures from climatic means will occur, but their timing cannot be forecast. The responses to climate by biological systems are diverse in character because intervening processes introduce a variety of amplifications, time lags, feedbacks, and non-linearities. Decadal ecosystem variability can involve a variety of climate to ecosystem transfer functions. These can be expected to convert red noise of the physical system to redder (lower frequency) noise of the biological response, but can also convert climatic red noise to more abrupt and discontinuous biological shifts, transient climatic disturbance to prolonged ecosystem recovery, and perhaps transient disturbance to sustained ecosystem regimes. All of these ecosystem response characteristics are likely to be active for at least some locations and time periods, leading to a mix of slow fluctuations, prolonged trends, and step-like changes in ecosystems and fish populations in response to climate change. Climate variables such as temperatures and winds can have strong teleconnections (large spatial covariability) within individual ocean basins, but between-basin teleconnections, and potential climate-driven biological synchrony over several decades, are usually much weaker and a highly intermittent function of the conditions prevailing at the time within the adjoining basins. As noted in the recent IPCC 4th Assessment Report, a warming trend of ocean surface layers and loss of regional sea ice is likely before 2030, due to addition of greenhouse gases. Combined with large continuing natural climate variability, this will stress ecosystems in ways that they have not encountered for at least 100s of years.},

@article{Hidalgo:2011aa,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: The synergistic effects of fishing, climate and internal dynamics on population fluctuations are poorly understood due to the complexity of these interactions. In this paper, we combine time series analysis and simulations to investigate the long-term dynamics of an overexploited population in the Mediterranean Sea, and its link with both fishing-induced demographic changes and hydroclimatic variability. We show that the cyclicity of the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) of European hake <i>Merluccius merluccius</i> (EH) vanished in the 1980s, while the correlation between the CPUE and a local environmental index increased. Using simulations, we then show that the cyclicity observed in the EH biomass before the 1980s can have an internal origin, while that its disappearance could be due to the fishing-induced erosion of the age structure. Our results suggest that fishing can trigger a switch from internally generated to externally forced population fluctuations, the latter being characterised by an increasing dependency of the population on recruitment and ultimately on environmental variability. Hydroclimatic modifications occurring in the Mediterranean in the early 1980s could have enhanced these changes by leading to a mismatch between early life stages of EH and favorable environmental conditions. Our conclusions underline the key effect of the interaction between exploitation and climate on the dynamics of EH and its important consequences for management and conservation. },

	Abstract = {While documentation of climate effects on marine ecosystems has a long history, the underlying processes have often been elusive. In this paper we review some of the ecosystem responses to climate variability and discuss the possible mechanisms through which climate acts. Effects of climatological and oceanographic variables, such as temperature, sea ice, turbulence, and advection, on marine organisms are discussed in terms of their influence on growth, distribution, reproduction, activity rates, recruitment and mortality. Organisms tend to be limited to specific thermal ranges with experimental findings showing that sufficient oxygen supply by ventilation and circulation only occurs within these ranges. Indirect effects of climate forcing through effects on the food web are also discussed. Research and data needs required to improve our knowledge of the processes linking climate to ecosystem changes are presented along with our assessment of our ability to predict ecosystem responses to future climate change scenarios.},

@article{Worm:2003,
	Abstract = {Here we present a meta-analytic approach to analyzing population interactions across the North Atlantic Ocean. We assembled all available biomass time series for a well-documented predator--prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whether the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the ``top-down'' or the ``bottom-up'' hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the ``top-down'' view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod--shrimp relationship, however, declined with increasing mean temperature. These results show that changes in predator populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas. In order to further investigate these processes, we establish a methodological framework to analyze species interactions from time series data.},

@article{PLANQUE2010403,
	Abstract = {Evidence has accumulated that climate variability influences the state and functioning of marine ecosystems. At the same time increasing pressure from exploitation and other human activities has been shown to impact exploited and non-exploited species and potentially modify ecosystem structure. There has been a tendency among marine scientists to pose the question as a dichotomy, i.e., whether (1) ``natural'' climate variability or (2) fishery exploitation bears the primary responsibility for population declines in fish populations and the associated ecosystem changes. However, effects of both climate and exploitation are probably substantially involved in most cases. More importantly, climate and exploitation interact in their effects, such that climate may cause failure in a fishery management scheme but that fishery exploitation may also disrupt the ability of a resource population to withstand, or adjust to, climate changes. Here, we review how exploitation, by altering the structure of populations and ecosystems, can modify their ability to respond to climate. The demographic effects of fishing (removal of large-old individuals) can have substantial consequences on the capacity of populations to buffer climate variability through various pathways (direct demographic effects, effects on migration, parental effects). In a similar way, selection of population sub-units within meta-populations may also lead to a reduction in the capacity of populations to withstand climate variability and change. At the ecosystem level, reduced complexity by elimination of species, such as might occur by fishing, may be destabilizing and could lead to reduced resilience to perturbations. Differential exploitation of marine resources could also promote increased turnover rates in marine ecosystems, which would exacerbate the effects of environmental changes. Overall (and despite the specificities of local situations) reduction in marine diversity at the individual, population and ecosystem levels will likely lead to a reduction in the resilience and an increase in the response of populations and ecosystems to future climate variability and change. Future management schemes will have to consider the structure and functioning of populations and ecosystems in a wider sense in order to maximise the ability of marine fauna to adapt to future climates.},

@article{PERRY2010427,
	Abstract = {Modern fisheries research and management must understand and take account of the interactions between climate and fishing, rather than try to disentangle their effects and address each separately. These interactions are significant drivers of change in exploited marine systems and have ramifications for ecosystems and those who depend on the services they provide. We discuss how fishing and climate forcing interact on individual fish, marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems to bring these levels into states that are more sensitive to (i.e. more strongly related with) climate forcing. Fishing is unlikely to alter the sensitivities of individual finfish and invertebrates to climate forcing. It will remove individuals with specific characteristics from the gene pool, thereby affecting structure and function at higher levels of organisation. Fishing leads to a loss of older age classes, spatial contraction, loss of sub-units, and alteration of life history traits in populations, making them more sensitive to climate variability at interannual to interdecadal scales. Fishing reduces the mean size of individuals and mean trophic level of communities, decreasing their turnover time leading them to track environmental variability more closely. Marine ecosystems under intense exploitation evolve towards stronger bottom--up control and greater sensitivity to climate forcing. Because climate change occurs slowly, its effects are not likely to have immediate impacts on marine systems but will be manifest as the accumulation of the interactions between fishing and climate variability --- unless threshold limits are exceeded. Marine resource managers need to develop approaches which maintain the resilience of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to the combined and interacting effects of climate and fishing. Overall, a less-heavily fished marine system, and one which shifts the focus from individual species to functional groups and fish communities, is likely to provide more stable catches with climate variability and change than would a heavily fished system.},

@article{Hsieh:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Fishing depletes fish stocks by removing fish from the sea. Clear enough, but in the late 1970s, theorists suggested that it also reduces the resilience of fish populations in the face of change. Discussion on the topic has remained theoretical until now: the availability of a 50-year larval fish survey of waters off California, begun when sardine populations there collapsed in the 1940s, provides the data. And it seems that fishing does magnify population variability (reducing resilience) in ways that extend beyond the removals themselves. A truncated age structure, with larger and older fish being removed first, is the likely cause. This suggests that to avoid collapse, fisheries must be managed not only to sustain total biomass, but also to maintain the age structure of a population.},

	Abstract = {Abstract Off southern-central Chile, the impact of spring upwelling variability on common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) recruitment was examined by analyzing satellite and coastal station winds, satellite chlorophyll, and common sardine recruitment from a stock assessment model. In austral spring, the intensity of wind-driven upwelling is related to sea surface temperature (SST) from the Ni{\~n}o 3.4 region, being weak during warm periods (El Ni{\~n}o) and strong during cold periods (La Ni{\~n}a). Interannual changes in both spring upwelling intensity and SST from the Ni{\~n}o 3.4 region are related to changes in remotely sensed chlorophyll over the continental shelf. In turn, year-to-year changes in coastal chlorophyll are tightly coupled to common sardine recruitment. We propose that, in the period 1991--2004, interannual changes in the intensity of spring upwelling affected the abundance and availability of planktonic food for common sardine, and consequently determined pre-recruit survival and recruitment strength. However, the importance of density-dependent factors on the reproductive dynamic cannot be neglected, as a negative association exists between spawning biomass and recruitment-per-spawning biomass. Coastal chlorophyll, upwelling intensity, and SST anomalies from the Ni{\~n}o 3.4 region could potentially help to predict common sardine recruitment scenarios under strong spring upwelling and El Ni{\~n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related anomalies.},
